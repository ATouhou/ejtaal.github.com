<h3>About this statement:</h3>

<p>
I decided to make this page to provide a balance against the very often quoted verse below:

<pre>
Reg of the People's Front of Judea:

"All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, 
public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public 
health, what have the Romans ever done for us?"
</pre>

This statement is often placed in a context to make it seem that nearly all great
achievements in the western world were initiated by the Roman Empire. The purpose
of this document is to present a focus on Islamic and muslim contributions to the
global body of knowledge and a nuanciation and perhaps refution of the original 
statement regarding the Roman contributions.

<p>
<b>Why 'muslims' and not Islam?</b><br>
A valid point. My reasons are that some contributions were not directly a result
of muslims themselves, but rather people living and working within the Muslim
Empire. The thing to note in those cases is that similar contributions would not
have been possible or tolerated in Christian europe of that time. However, 
certain contributions will be shown to be inspired by Islamic religious texts
and reports.

<p>
Also, certain things were not directly created from scratch by the muslims but were
rather improved upon, so one would not be able to say that Islam was the direct
cause of that particular thing.
