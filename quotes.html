"Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.? That's a tough one, but I'll
give it a shot. Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on
my desk, something nobody else can break. So I take a shot at it
and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did
my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel
army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location,
they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen
hundred people I never had a problem with get killed. Now the
politicians are sayin', "Send in the marines to secure the area"
'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there,
gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number was called,
'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be
some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass. And he comes home
to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country
he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass
got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no
bathroom breaks. Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only
reason he was over there was so we could install a government that
would sell us oil at a good price. And of course the oil companies
used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick
buck. A cute little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping
my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And naturally they're takin' their
sweet time bringin' the oil back, and maybe even took the liberty
of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and play
slalom with the icebergs, and it ain't too long 'til he hits one,
spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic.
So my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive, so he's got
to walk to the job interviews, which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in
his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's
starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only
blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with
Quaker State. So what do I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin'
better. Why not just shoot my buddy, take his job and give it to
his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby
seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? I could be
elected president."

"...Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural
equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do
not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is
to spread to another area. There is another organism on this
planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A
virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. ..."

Now what is the message there? The message is that there are no
"knowns." There are thing we know that we know. There are known
unknowns. That is to say there are things that we now know we
don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things
we don't know we don't know. So when we do the best we can and
we pull all this information together, and we then say well that's
basically what we see as the situation, that is really only the
known knowns and the known unknowns. And each year, we discover
a few more of those unknown unknowns.

The second-cheapest department to run at a university is Mathematics;

pencils don't really exist anyway."

<p><b>
Modern industrial civilization has developed within a certain system
of convenient myths. The driving force of our industrial civilization
has been individual material gain, which is accepted as legitimate,
even praiseworthy on the grounds that private vices yield public
benefits, in the classic formulation. Now it's long been understood,
very well, that a society that is based on this principle will
destroy itself in time. It can only persist with whatever suffering
and injustice it entails, as long as it's possible to pretend that
the destructive forces that humans create are limited, that the
world is an infinite resource, and that the world is an infinite
garbage can.

These are not just academic exercises. We're not analyzing the media
on Mars, or in the 18th century, or something like that. We're
dealing with real human beings who are suffering and dying and being
tortured and starving, because of policies that we are involved in
we as citizens of democratic societies are directly involved in and
responsible for. And what the media are doing is ensuring that we
do not act on our responsibilities, and that the interests of power
are served, not the interests of suffering people and not the needs
of the American people who would be horrified if they realized the
blood that's dripping from their hands because of the way they're
allowing themselves to be deluded and manipulated by the system.

<li>the job title 'Quality Adviser' has been renamed to 'Service Delivery Improvement Manager'
    (seen at a certain organisation in the UK)
<li>If it's not in my repository, it's not really worth keeping.
    (regarding which files to backup, because ideally only the repository needs backing up)
<li>When no-one visits your website, at least the robots will.
<li>The annoying things about public transport are twofold: the public, and the transport.
<li>That only took too long! (when something took a long time)
<li>Wikipedia: Whatever is written on some dodgy website must be true enough to use as a source.
<li>Wikipedia: If a horde of angsty, white, 17 year olds living in their moms basement don't agree 
    with your input it gets deleted.
<li>Many western nations are proud of certain things in their past. However on close inspection
  of these things it will turn out that there isn't anything to be really proud of.
<li>The golden rule "treat others as you would like to be treated" reflects the arrogance and 
  self-righteousness of those that invented it. It should of course be "Treat others as
  they would like to be treated".
<li>It's easier to single handedly crumble the Himalayas with a pickaxe than to change your or someone else's
  character for the better.
<li>The presence of royalty with power in countries claiming to be democratic is a sign of major hypocrisy.
<li>It seems that everything that is popular is crap.
<li>Common people's preoccupation can be gauged from the fact that anything educational in a book shop
  is labeled 'non-fiction'. They're as much non-fiction as a car is a horseless carriage.
<li>I am now legally allowed to operate a multi-ton chunk of steel with wheels, at lethal velocities
  on public roads. (In other words, "I received my driving license.")
<li>A man's responsibilities are roughly proportional to the size of his key chain.
<li>There's a man in a van driving slowly through my street, shouting something unintelligible every
    10 meters. Perhaps he is proudly showing off his collection of rusty iron things in the back.
<li>It's fascinating how saying "Word!" implies: "I follow your line of reasoning and concur with 
    your general assessment"
<li>Any technology not resembling magic is insufficiently advanced.
<li>My capitalistic observation: It exists, therefor it is either profitable or funded by a wealthy entity.
<li>My second capitalistic observation: Individualism is the fuel of consumerism and capitalism.
<li>When dealing with Oracle software, all rules of logic and reproducibility are suspended.
<li>Government employees will be the last ones to complain about tax rises.
<li>"Best served chilled" means: This stuff tastes horrible at room temperature!
<li>My motto in life is : "I will never compromise on my ideal of always being pragmatic and realistic in all matters."
(Doesn't quite carry the contradiction I want it to have yet, I'm working on it ;) )
<li>Real changes in government are not achieved by elections but through other means. (or: Real change is never effected by elections.)
<li>Wherever I look for confirmation bias, I seem to find it, and I don't encounter cognitive dissonance when I'm trying to avoid it.
<li>If it's not documented, it might as well not exist.
<li>Given the cut throat capitalistic global economy, it will be extremely hard to become rich trading physical items.
<li>With the invention of the internet and all the new communication tools it provides, people all over the world and now able to ignore eachother in many new ways.
<li>You can't earn any gross profit unless you're stinking filthy rich.
<li>Who throws the ketchup up, must catch the ketchup down.
<li>I guess one of the first signs of getting old is being able to fall asleep while sitting.
<li>I could tell you what quid pro quo means, but only if you'll tell me what pro bono means.
<li>The summers in the UK last just long enough to make you forget how cold and gloomy the rest of the year is.
<li>The dutch people are known to be quite humble, and they're so darn proud of it too! (Adapted from someone else ;)
<li>You know there's someone from holland living in the house when you see a bunch of unopened hotel soap bottles gathering dust in the bathroom
<li>Never assume anything in this world will remain the same
<li>I find the signs saying 'End' after a traffic jam very disconcerting. The end of what? End of the motorway? The world as we know it? End of my life??
<li>An optimist might think immortality might still be a reasonable possibility, after all, only 19 out of 20 people that have ever lived have died.
<li>Genuine caffeine addiction would be becoming optimistic and hard working at the thought of the mere prospect of drinking some coffee.
<li>Things we need for things we want wouldn't be needed if we didn't want those things.
<li>Save the environment: don't print my email as it wouldn't be worth the paper it's printed on
<li>Perhaps if you think you're a bad "X" (e.g. father, muslim, ...) with much room for improvement it may be that you're actually a good one.
